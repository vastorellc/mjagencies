# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** Every page, every agency, every image slot is 100% real and complete at launch — only the Brand Setup Wizard remains for the user post-generate.
**Current focus:** Phase 06 — seo-plugin-engine (executing — 4/6 plans complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 06 (seo-plugin-engine) — EXECUTING, 4/6 plans complete (06-01, 06-02, 06-03, 06-04 done)
Status: Plan 06-04 complete 2026-04-27 — geo-chunking plugin, 3-plugin engine now complete
Last activity: 2026-04-27 -- Plan 06-04 complete — geo-chunking scoring plugin, 19 tests, all 3 plugins registered

Progress: [█████████░] 86%

## Completed Phases

| Phase | Plans | Key Deliverable | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 01 (foundation-infra) | 5/6 done | Turborepo monorepo, Next.js 15, Payload 3.82.1, Docker Compose, CI/CD, OTel | ✓ (01-06 Doppler deferred) |
| 02 (multi-tenant-db) | 6/6 | Per-agency Postgres + PgBouncer + Drizzle schema + RLS + audit log | ✓ |
| 03 (auth-sso-edge) | 6/6 | JWT/jose auth, MFA, SSO, Cloudflare middleware, server-action auth pattern | ✓ |
| 04 (design-system) | 4/5 done | 6-layer CSS tokens, 12 OKLCH themes, AJV validator, A/B framework, Storybook CI | ✓ (04-02 summary missing) |
| 05 (central-cms) | 8/8 | Payload CMS wired, 11 collections, 45 blocks, Lexical editor, DAM, content sprint | ✓ |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Payload CMS pinned to 3.82.1 exactly — never upgrade without explicit approval
- `jose` only for JWT — `jsonwebtoken` banned (Edge runtime incompatible)
- All 11 agencies live at launch — no MVP tiering
- Content-Complete at build time — only Brand Setup Wizard remains for user post-generate
- Per-agency Postgres + PgBouncer + RLS — strong tenant isolation
- Yjs real-time collaboration deferred to v2
- 45 React block components use `var(--mj-*)` tokens only — zero hex literals
- SEO/AIO/GEO panels are stubs in Phase 5 — Phase 6 replaces with real plugin engine
- AI hooks stubs in Phase 5 (`isStub: true`) — Phase 7 wires real LiteLLM calls
- SerializedLexicalNode imported from 'lexical' package (not @payloadcms/richtext-lexical)
- Plugin engine uses registerPlugin/runPluginEngine pattern — plans 02-04 plug in scoring logic
- computeLiveScore uses requireSession() (not auth()) per project auth pattern
- seo-classic plugin registration via index.ts export chain (not engine.ts bottom import) — avoids circular ESM dependency
- PluginDefaults not re-exported from engine.ts; seo-classic.ts receives pre-merged SeoClassicConfig via config.seo_classic
- aio-citations plugin follows same index.ts export self-registration pattern as seo-classic
- blockPublishOnUnsourcedStat flag preserved in AioCitationsConfig interface but not used by scorer (only CMS publish gate)
- FAQPage JSON-LD injection in page <head> is Phase 8 scope; Phase 6 delivers utility functions only
- validateAioTldr exempt from legal pages; enforced only on status=published
- geo-chunking plugin registration follows same index.ts export chain pattern (not engine.ts side-effect import) — consistent with seo-classic and aio-citations
- Non-applicable short-circuit (pageType != services) checked before empty-cities check — blog/home pages always score 100 regardless of city config

### Pending Todos

- Run `doppler login` then resume Plan 01-06 (Doppler workspace bootstrap)
- Write missing 04-02 SUMMARY.md (code is done, commits b48476c–711f0b8)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

| Docs | Plan 04-02 SUMMARY.md missing | Code committed (b48476c, 938cdea, 9b7a889); summary never written | 2026-04-26 |
